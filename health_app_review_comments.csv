 load can peak and once again be detectable for a period of time. You should be fully informed."

10,CDC,
,,"helpful! wish there were checkboxes for ""risk enhancers"", specifically HIV. If those were there, I'd make it a 5 star rating. otherwise, it's great!"
,,excellent app. i use it everyday in my practice
,,"I have just calculated the same risk in heart disease calculator and got 6.5% risk, so I am not sure which is which especially on the basis of evidence based medicine, nevertheless I am trusting ACC (American College of Cardiology)"
,,The app is useless. It does not allow calculation for patients older than 59.
,,this is very helpfully app for clinical assessments
,,very useful and practical
,,very helpful tool
,,Doesn't work anymore
,,The Best
,,good
,,Fantastic
,,perfect
,,Automatic update to plus. You added med recommendations previous data etc....but text is too big. What happened to th aesthetically pleasing version that would not freeze up when going from tab to tab...needs more work. Otherwise great bedside calculator!
,,good
,,Needs patch. Not able to calculate above age 59 despite saying you can calculate to 79.
,,good for use
,,"I used to love this app, but now it refuses to calculate risk in anyone over age 59. That needs to be fixed. Thanks"
,,No data for age above 59!! Fix it!
,,"SI unit change to mmol, but in my phone the pad does not have a "" . "" "" decimal"" point ??"
,,"Use almost daily in clinical practice as a PCP. The patient info entry seems a little cumbersome post update, not sure how to rectify that."
,,"Tells me that they need a high intensity statin, but doesn't tell me what dose is considered to be high intensity. Other apps are more helpful."
,,"needed to wipe the app & restart it. Now after that? Works perfectly. Thanks heart people! //Tried to get my assessment, but even after completing the first section, it still says ""all fields required"". But they're all filled in! Sigh."
,,"Please fix it!!! Halts and locks up when trying to move between tabs and pages... Don't understand why it should behave so erratically. User should be able to ""reset"" it to input different parameters easily... I often just restart it. Kludgy."
,,"Very good app¬†Loved the app. I wish they could allow for both mg/dl and mmol/l, have to convert first its a bit tedious"
,,"Previous version worked perfectly and I used it every day in my office. This ""Plus"" one, to which I was updated without my consent, does not even allow data input with numerical keyboard. An excellent app ruined. Uninstalled."
,,Love it!¬†I like that I can plug in my patient's numbers and show them their risk right in their lab review session.
,,"Please add SI units¬†Good interface and accurate scientific content, but unusable outside the US without the option to input standard units (mmol/L) for cholesterol levels."
,,"Layout looks good¬†Appears to be easy to use with great supplemental information on diet, exercise, monitoring, etc... Good addition to my practice."
,,What an app!¬†Best app for cv risk calculator. No problem encountered. Summary recommendation is awesome. This sums up the 85 page pdf file from ACC/AHA.
,,"Works as Expected, but...¬†I like all of the useful information that I received from this app. I gave it four stars b/c it would not accept my real total cholesterol value of 108. I had to input 130 instead to get a calculated result."
,,Extremely cumbersome to enter data and to convert units eg metric to non metric measurements and American to international units. The rotating wheel format is much more time consuming than direct numeric entry.
,,"Have to re load for new phone, won't carryover.Otherwise excellent"
,,"CVD Risk Calculator¬†Awesome for health care providers, and good source of info for patients."
,,Stinks¬†How can you make an app that tells me that I am in error when I enter my cholesterol levels? Do NOT download this app if you have FH; it wont help you at all.
,,Needs SI units please!¬†Many countries look to these recommendations but their labs report in SI units. This would be a major improvement.
,,"Easy to use. Includes great information in addition to the risk rating, such as station intensity table."
,,"useful but...¬†very useful but as most of the world uses si units for biochemistry, it would be most useful if these would be included."
,,Please include accept values in micromoles/L as well...
,,Great tool for med students¬†Great for third and fourth year clerkships especially in primary care specialties.
,,Good job¬†I have been impressed with the application it has made our life easier
,,Heart Risk¬†Excellent app. Especially medical providers

,AHA Guidelines On-the-Go,
,,"I've had this app for maybe a year or two before the Covid-19 pandemic. It used to always be fact and science based, focusing on what you need to know to stay safe! However, recently the ""articles"" have been touting Trump's ""strong and swift action"" in dealing with this virus. I don't need to read a bunch of political BS before getting to the useful information and data! This is really a shameful decline and I will be uninstalling and getting my health and safety information elsewhere."
,,"For ""up-to-the-minute"" reporting, this app is three weeks past due. The CDC direct website is easier to navigate with factual details than this half-assed attempt of an app. My google web browser lends more useful up to date info than this app does. When i attempt to navigate the app it sends me to the CDC website. Think ill save memory space. *delete*"
,,"THE APP IS NOT OPENING UP TO THE PAGES THAT ARE LINKED WITH THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION . ITS A BLANK WHITE PAGE MY ISP INTERNET CONNECTION IS WORKING FINE. ITS YOUR APP NOT WORKING FRIDAY IT WORKED SEVERAL DAYS AGO, BUT NOW ITS USELESS"
,,"This app is worthless. As others have shared, it does not even list Covid19 or Wuhan as a current disease, let alone the pandemic that we are living through as a nation and world. This is an app which by design and definition, it should be fully operational on your smart phone. Otherwise, it offers no benefit for our current crisis."
,,"Ever since the COVID-19 Coronavirus struck the U.S., I want to be more informed and so I installed the CDC app so I can be so. Unfortunately for me however, everytime I tap on notifications fron this app, this app fails to display the news article it notified me about within the app once it starts it."
,,It's a very confusing app. You see a topic and you cick on it and it takes you to page that does not continue the article and you can't find where the continuation of the article is. Considering how important this app should be it really sucks in getting the info you need
,,"App does not stay up to date. When you receive a notification and click, it takes you to a blank page. When you check your states info goes to an error page."
,,"I haven't found anything of the issues that others reviewers had using this app. The app works as its claims and then some. Honestly, I really don't know what are they talking about. Happy with the app, so I give a 5 star rating. Case closed."
,,Bad.....Data is not updated. This app shows my stse has none. Our positive covid-19 started 3 weeks ago and now 500. This app is not worth bothering with.
,,Can't believe that they omitted the corona virus from their disease case counts. No stats what so ever. Super blunder! Unbelievable!!!
,,Same as using the webpage. Useless. Just use the browser and see the same faster. It should have notifications about the alerts they issue but it doesn't.
,,"The app is almost completely USELESS, just like the CDC itself!"
,,"I just downloaded this app and it not only covers the coronavirus pandemic, but issues concerning the public. Very informative."
,,Last update Covid-19 date back to 4 days and it's not even an update. This app is poor and cannot be relied upon.
,,"Very informative, loads of info on anything your looking for. Great app."
,,"Google is really trying a bit too hard with censorship here, by not allowing any Corona virus informational or mapping/tracking apps other those from the government medical industrial complex. 1984."
,,"Most pages don't load at all, they show a ""webpage not available"". This is a government app supposed to provide critical information to citizens..?"
,,"very good, lots of good info, that's needed at this time in steed of listing to rumors floating around"
,,A great app for me I can stay up to the minut on any changes occuring.
,,Google has better info plus the numbers are not correct what a waist of time loading this app
,,Everytime I try to get on the app it says check your Internet connection and I have mobile data. Please fix
,,Screens don't load. White pages. Data fine.
,,"Good information, always-on updates... User-friendly"
,,"App works 100%, must be user error on those poorly rated reviews. Literally gives up to the second into on covid-19 including how many boomers have been eradicated and the plans that trumps space force is working on to gather up all the infected and use them as building material in his space-boarder wall because those gad dang martians are the ones who caused this whole mess because of long unbroken run on sentences full of grammatical errors and weird anger towards the elderly who don't know up"
,,Excellent site for information on current adversity in the medical community effecting the US public and solutions to the public and government solutions to the biological virus affecting the US.
,,Loved that I could go to a site that had true information about this virus and so much morr
,,I like the amount of true document info that the CDC... Control Disease Center has to offer the whole world.
,,Why did the wearing masks thing change overnight exactly? You stated that a bandana doest protect you from Covid-19 because the virus could pass though that and then all of a sudden now it does. Can't believe anything this place states.
,,Can't locate case numbers. Covid-19 not listed.
,,Garbage App! Blank articles and poorly put together!
,,During these trying times it's very effective to ease mind.
,,Very bad. Not organized at all. Platform sucks
,,"It's just links to articles, no different than a website."
,,"It's the only coronavirus app, so make it good. Just won't load. This is dangerous!!"
,,"Everyone needs this app ,especially at this time. Thank you for all the information and FACTS. EASY TO FOLLOW AND UNDERSTAND."
,,"The information for my area; state, country and town is old news. Over 3 weeks old. Useless."
,,"Very informative. I keeps me in the '""know'"" . I work in the medical field so knowing and preparation are key !"
,,No more information than on the website and poorly organized.
,,Worse then using the webpage. Seems to not even be able to load information about state's situation would much rather use the webpage.
,,THIS IS A EXCELLENT APP EVERYONE SHOULD DOWNLOAD IT NOW FOR SAFETY REASONS AND TO KEEP TRACK OF THE VIRUS.
,,Easy to use and understand
,,"Good but BUGS¬†Filters gets reset when I swith apps and I have to set them again. When I press the phone back key, the app closes. And articles are slow to load. I would give 5 star if these are corrected"
,,"I think this app is amazing! If you're looking for an app to get the latest news on outbreaks or infections and diseases in general, it's for you! I think a notification feature on the areas you want would make this app even better. Please take this into account as I wpuld love this to become a thing! Thank you."

,,"Would have given it full marks except the app is buggy. The window that makes you select your role and speciality doesn't let you move from there. Occasionally it will allow you to move forward and actually look at the algorithms. The apple version of the app works fine on my iPad, so its disappointing that the playstore version doesn't work. Very disappointing."
,,when I open app it always ask about classification and speciality. then app stuks at this point. The app is also heavy on phone memory. otherwise I would have loved it .
,,this app seemed like it could have been useful but I was never able to get passed entering my occupation or running updates. literally never saw a guideline.
,,"Sloppy! Buttons don't work, can't even get past initial dialog box, lol"
,,"App wont load, it either immediately closes itself or just gives me a permanent white screen."

,,Cannot submit the Classification & Speciality choices to proceed further in Android version

,,"needed to wipe the app & restart it. Now after that? Works perfectly. Thanks heart people! //Tried to get my assessment, but even after completing the first section, it still says ""all fields required"". But they're all filled in! Sigh."
,,"Please fix it!!! Halts and locks up when trying to move between tabs and pages... Don't understand why it should behave so erratically. User should be able to ""reset"" it to input different parameters easily... I often just restart it. Kludgy."
,,"Very good app¬†Loved the app. I wish they could allow for both mg/dl and mmol/l, have to convert first its a bit tedious"
,,"Previous version worked perfectly and I used it every day in my office. This ""Plus"" one, to which I was updated without my consent, does not even allow data input with numerical keyboard. An excellent app ruined. Uninstalled."
,,Love it!¬†I like that I can plug in my patient's numbers and show them their risk right in their lab review session.
,,"Please add SI units¬†Good interface and accurate scientific content, but unusable outside the US without the option to input standard units (mmol/L) for cholesterol levels."
,,"Layout looks good¬†Appears to be easy to use with great supplemental information on diet, exercise, monitoring, etc... Good addition to my practice."
,,What an app!¬†Best app for cv risk calculator. No problem encountered. Summary recommendation is awesome. This sums up the 85 page pdf file from ACC/AHA.
,,"Works as Expected, but...¬†I like all of the useful information that I received from this app. I gave it four stars b/c it would not accept my real total cholesterol value of 108. I had to input 130 instead to get a calculated result."
,,Extremely cumbersome to enter data and to convert units eg metric to non metric measurements and American to international units. The rotating wheel format is much more time consuming than direct numeric entry.
,,"Have to re load for new phone, won't carryover.Otherwise excellent"
,,"CVD Risk Calculator¬†Awesome for health care providers, and good source of info for patients."
,,Stinks¬†How can you make an app that tells me that I am in error when I enter my cholesterol levels? Do NOT download this app if you have FH; it wont help you at all.
,,Needs SI units please!¬†Many countries look to these recommendations but their labs report in SI units. This would be a major improvement.
,,"Easy to use. Includes great information in addition to the risk rating, such as station intensity table."
,,"useful but...¬†very useful but as most of the world uses si units for biochemistry, it would be most useful if these would be included."
,,Please include accept values in micromoles/L as well...

,Heart Attack Risk Calculator - Clardia,
,,"Works well and is easy to use. In the early days I had a few problems with loss of connection to the Qardio cuff, but now it seems pretty reliable. As far as I can tell, the readings are a good match to those at the doctor's surgery and from a well-regarded Omron home monitor. The ability to take the average of multiple readings and log them to Apple's or Google's health apps is great."
,,"The blood pressure cuff only fits on my forearm, not the upper arm. Getting it to connect to the bluetooth of my phone takes some effort. I like the fact that the reading goes directly to my doctor."
,,"Needs rerolling instructions. I can't figure out how to roll it like it was when it arrived and since that is one of the main features, not to mention the only way to shut it off, it should have had directions for doing it correctly."
,,The app is good. Easy to use and graphing is well presented. Battery life of the qardio device could be greatly improved. Ability to email full results would also be handy.
,,This unit makes it extremely easy to track my readings and share them with my medical professionals. My primary nurse even commented that she loves the report that I send at regular intervals.
,,"Easy to use, fairly quick and accuracy corresponds very well to medically approved blood pressure devices. I love the history retention and ability to send to my primary care physician. Also to measure BP for others without disturbing my readings. Only reason I didn't give five stars is how quickly it goes thru batteries."
,,"Easy to use, convenient, keeps a record of your bp. Also it's being monitored"
,,"Having problems with app.takes measurements ok butthe problem is the history,all of sudden the historypast measurement are gone, i had measurement since the first of jan 2020,now they are all gone the only thing that show up is the dayily reading and tomarrow they will be gone.it shows the date and times and that all!!! I got a new phone samsungA20 and the app worked for about a week anow nothing, i have triedputting the new app & updated and still the same problem.i got this app andQardio arm"
,,Nice gadgets. Fairly accurate. Smart phone interface is pretty good. An useful product to have at home.
,,Great method to monitor blood pressure and especially easy to carry on trips. Recommend it greatly.
,,"This app, with the Bluetooth Blood pressure cuff, is very helpful. I take daily readings I provide to my doc. He uses the info to inform my treatment."
,,The app gives me the information to manage my heart and blood pressure to stay healthy. It also provides information regarding my A-Fib that helps me be aware of problems.
,,Works very well. I came over from one of the other Bluetooth cuffs and I like Quardio better. The historical views are better as is sharing with the doctors.
,,Just used it first time. Super easy to setup and seems accurate. My first impression is this is a top quality device.
,,Great device...but occasionally it doesn't want to turn on/connect.
,,Love it!!!! And keeping track is wonderful hit a button and all your history with date and time is right there
,,It responds most of time. It is great when my phone can connect to unit
,,Very easy to use. Keeps track easily and helps to show patterns
,,"Because my blood pressure fluxuates from too low to too high, Qardio Heart has been AWESOME with assisting me in determing how often and how much medication to take, or not take, daily."
,,"This serves as a good tracker, especially when you have a history of heart disease."
,,Crashes and won't work now after their last update. No way to undo their update.
,,Great product and easy to use. Very accurate so it gives you piece of mind.
,,Very easy to use and store information to display to doctor.
,,Very easy to use and compact.
,,After the last update is crashing and I can't use it anymore....
,,Compact monitor. Easy to use app.
,,Qardio app no longer syncing with Google fit after latest update.
,,It is friendly use App and would be great if it includes WIFI connectivity
,,"I like being able to look back at dates and times, to compare changes."
,,Very easy to use and convenient!
,,Good reliable blood pressure monitoring.
,,Very irregular results. Not very accurate
,,Quick and easy to use. Would like a quicker way to turn off. I take the top off each time. Good graphics. Is there a way to select just morning or evening results in the graphics?
,,Very accurate and easy to use.
,,"Pretty new but so far so good! It did take some work to pair the app with my cardio cuff. Once that was done it has been smooth. I like the ""3 reading and take the average"" option. I have white coat syndrome and this is helping. Also, my doctor will get a month of readings at my next visit. Thinking about the qardiobase 2..."
,,More than five stars
,,nice app
,,Excellent app
,,excellent
,,"This is useless. The older version was amazing. Journal scan, quick access to articles etc."
,,Amazing app ...waiting for more guidelines...¬†It ends arguments really quick
,,Tanks¬†But your app have not cpr guidline

,,No more guidelines..?¬†Until full guidelines arrive

,,"This is horrible. There is no structure, random content, no naming convention. Very poor. This couldn't have been tested, and based on the already 2.3 rating, I'm not an outliar."
,,good one
,,Its missing alot of info like Acls and APLS .ATLS so please fix to more stars or its not recommended to other fellows
,,Casserole of random nonsense. No ACLS guidelines? Very disappointing.
,,Poorly organized. Limited information. Weak
,,"Missing a lot of information ACLS, PALS, etc."
,,Falsely advertised. Incomplete.
,,"I am getting an ""HTTP 400 and request"" error. Please help."
,,HTTP 400 Bad Request :(
,,Broken
,,App will not open. Timed out then error message. You need to test application before releasing app. Really gives AHA a bad name when things do not work. Will try it again when I hear the bugs are gone and application works.
,,"The app does not work, reading other reviews it seems older versions do work however. Please switch back to the old version until the bugs are fixed, this seems like a very good idea and would be very useful."
,,HTTP 400 bad request¬†That's the error massage I got after it failed to load. Uninstalling.
,,"Unlike others, this app worked for me. The interface is a bit clunky and some of the pages didn't seem to display all info but there are tons of scientific resources."
,,I expected a little more. This thing reads like 1970's stereo instructions.
,,Poor quality control. Installed but like most unable to open the app.
,,Similar to others: Http 400 bad request - uninstalling until more stable
,,Wouldn't Load¬†I downloaded the app and couldn't get it to load.
,,Unable to open the app.
,,It won't open after download. Looks promising. Please fix!!!!
,,Application will not load.

,,"Wow. Was hoping for a well made, useful app. Was completely disappointed. What a waste."
,,not happening
,,Installed. Took forever to open and only one guideline available. Not very slick. Useless at this point. Uninstalled.
,,Saves lives
,,It is wonderful helps finds information
,,I love it so much
,,welldone
,,Takes awhile to set up but otherwise perfect.
,,"Quick and easy to use. Matches the BP at my providers office, too. 1/29/29 - This device is still working well. It us easy to pack when traveling."
,,"Qardio's privacy policy is concerning. They can keep your information for as long as they deem neccesary to ""conduct business"" even if you've deactivated your account. Also, the app kept telling me it needed location data to function....why? Location data isn't needed for Bluetooth to work. Finally, the blood pressure device I purchased didn't work but the app was just stuck on a walkthrough loop. Like at some point, maybe point me to some troubleshooting blurbs."
,,Easy to use. Much more convenient than my standard unit. So nice to print the history when I have a doctor visit.
,,Easy to use and very accurate
,,I am not sure I trust the accuracy of the BP cuff. I would say based on my experience it's accurate to √∑/- 15%. Other than that it gives you a pretty good idea what your BP and heart rate are.
,,"Repeated issues with connecting via Bluetooth, especially with certain phones. For a very expensive device the help is poor. This device should connect seamlessly to all phones and devices since it cannot be operated in a manual mode."
,,"It could be more clear how to complete the setup of pairing your device to your phone, but the ease with which you can take your measurements after everything is set up is superlative. I'm very happy with my qardio arm and qardiobase 2."
,,"Easy to use, and greatly appreciate the apps integration with electronic health records at my Dr.'s office."
,,"Just started using it. So far it is fine, but only after a couple of attempts. Hope it stabilizes for a one off measurement."
,,Works great with iPhone and Samsung. Easy to use. Very accurate reading.
,,I love the ease of use and convenience factor. No more bulky machines or guess work.
,,"This is an excellent unit to monitor your blood pressure. It is small and compact, making it practical to take with you when traveling. You can also send all the measures to your doctor as well. I have been using it for more than a year, and can only speak greatly of it."
,,Very good and accurate. Accuracy was confirmed by my doctor. Easy to use.
,,"Very convenient way to record regular measurements. Follow the directions carefully to pair the device, both the Qardio and device's - it took me a few tries the first time."
,,I love this. I am a truck driver and it fits great in my lunch bag.
,,Easy to use and accurate
,,"loved my Qardio BP monitor , and my doctor loved it also."
,,So convenient! I take 3 readings at a time automatically for a more accurate measure. My Dr. just looked at the monthly trends to review my history. Storing the data on my phone is the best!
,,Qardio app in conjunction with Qardioarm is a great way to easily track your blood pressure. It's so easy to use and provides great visual displays of your BP.
,,Weight measurements don't sync to s health. Last email from support indicated they were aware and would be fixed in future release. Then why state it works with s health when it doesn't
,,Love it but found out the cuff is to small and was not getting accurate results. Not sure if it can be used on the wrist and get accurate readings
,,"I need to measure my blood pressure for doctors. This enables them to make a decision based on my results. I take it to the gym just to watch. I had quadruple by-pass, it's a nice reassurance."
,,Just got it. It's easy enough to use. Read the directions. It doesn't work the way you think... my only complaint so far is how long it took to ship. I should have just bought it on Amazon. I would have it last week.
,,Can be a little glitchy when taking measurements. If screensaver comes on I have to start all over again.
,,"Very easy to use, accurate when compared with readings from doctor's blood pressure cuff."
,,Easy to use. A little hard to pair up to my Note 10 plus as described but taking the battery cover off and replacing it did the trick.
,,Works its rated 5 stars. Question is will it work or not connect. If it doesn't connect there's nothing I can do to fix it. Right now it's connecting every morning so it's good.
,,It was great until I had to start uninstalling and installing the app to make it work which was probably about a month in.
,,Incredibly convenient to track BP throughout the day. I live the portability of the unit.
,,Why do I need yet another account just to log 3 numbers every day? Excel can do it.
,,Very easy to use. Easy to keep track of pressure
,,Have a little trouble getting it to start my 2nd time....but I like the phone app and how it keeps track.
,,Very good device. Very accurate. Very reliable and a great design.
,,App instructions are easy to follow and I like the ability to track my blood pressure.
,,I've had this unit for a few weeks and this will be my third time to change the batteries. At this rate I won't be able to afford this unit.
,,I like it keeps track of readings can email to my doctor if needed
,,MAJOR SECURITY RISK. WILLNOT WORK UNLESS YOU CRWZTE AN ACCOUNT ON THEIR SERVERS. APP IS ALSO CRIPPLED UNLESS YOU BUY THEIR DEVICE
,,Very easy to use and results match my readings at my medical appointments.
,,"Can't add information manually, only works with their devices"
,,"Like the fact you can take your blood pressure pretty much anywhere home, car, trains or planes. and at any hour."
,,"Work wonderful, gives accurate readings. Easy to carry around"

,,"Very portable and accurate reading, heart rate pulse reading not constant with blood pressure sleeve."
,,The cuff is hard to keep in place on my arm The cuff doesn't deflate so it can be stored in the box .
,,Very easy to use. Great to track blood pressure.
,,Qardio is a great app which helps monitor one's blood pressure quickly and often.
,,Easy to use and the info goes right to the doctor. I like it.
,,Bad measurements is impossible to delete from history. They are deletable within user session but return back after restart
,,This app makes it easy to track my blood pressure.
,,Easy to use and keep records.
,,Does what it claims to. Doctor and I satisfied with results.
,,Bad app. Unnecessary permissions and features. Poor communication.
,,My doctor check it with his way of taking BP n they were the same. So now he believes the reading.
,,Failure of device to turn on repeatedly and not completing final reading of 3 only aggravates and raises blood pressure
,,Plastics wear out...can't close battery cover
,,Very reliable instrument.... recommending to all
,,I take my blood pressure first thing in the morning so I can stay ahead of any issues. Qardio makes the reading easy to take and easy to record the results.
,,Very convenient. I really like tracking my BP and pulse on my phone plus being able to make notes. Great app! Great cuff!
,,"I love it! It records my BP on my smart phone so I easily share with my physician. I love no cords, or tubes to fight with. I like the 3 BP average too."
,,Works perfectly and gives accurate readings. Be sure to follow the instructions on having your phone near the cuff.
,,"Very convenient, easy to use (and I hope accurate!). Love being able to link with Bluetooth Cardiobase 2 scales for tracking on health apps."
,,"The easiest installation of any app and device I have experienced, ever. I was so impressed with blood pressure monitor that I bought their scale!"
,,"Convenient, but cross checking with a trusted arm unit showed this unit's systolic reading consistently about 12 points higher. Allow for that and it is a good value."
,,"As a cardiologist, I can say I have recommended the Qardio monitor to my patients and use it myself. Great way to record BP results over time."
,,Ok I will Love it for its convenient size and portability
,,"Terrible pairing experience on android. It most certainly was not just like magic as per the instructions, the omron device is far easier to use, and less bulky"
